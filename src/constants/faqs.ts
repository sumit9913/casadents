    question: "Are dental implants painful?",
    answer: "Dental implant surgery is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Most patients describe the discomfort afterward as similar to a tooth extraction—manageable with over-the-counter pain medication. We also offer sedation options for anxious patients. Our gentle approach and modern techniques minimize discomfort throughout your treatment.",

    question: "How long do dental implants last?",
    answer: "With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. The implant itself (the titanium post) integrates with your jawbone and becomes a permanent part of your body. The crown on top typically lasts 10-15 years or more, depending on wear and care. Regular dental check-ups and good oral hygiene are key to long-term success.",
